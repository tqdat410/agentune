# agentune

**Music Player for Agent.**

agentune is a local MCP music player for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and other MCP-compatible coding agents. Your agent can discover tracks, play instantly, queue the next song, and keep one shared listening session running while you work.

> CLI-only package: install and run `agentune` as a command. Programmatic `import "agentune"` is not a supported interface.

## Why agentune

- **Zero-auth setup**: no Spotify login, no Apple Music login, no API keys
- **Background play**: audio runs through `mpv`, not a browser tab
- **Auto start**: the daemon can start itself when your agent connects
- **Shared session**: queue, history, taste state, and dashboard stay in one local daemon
- **Browser dashboard**: live now-playing, queue, volume, taste, and listening insights
- **Cross-platform**: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- `mpv`
- `yt-dlp`

Use `agentune doctor` after install to verify the runtime sees the required dependencies, the bundled `yt-dlp` binary, the system `yt-dlp` command, and the current daemon state.

### macOS

```bash
brew install mpv yt-dlp
```

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install mpv python3-pip
pip install yt-dlp
```

### Windows

```bash
scoop install mpv yt-dlp
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install agentune

```bash
npm install -g agentune
agentune --version
agentune doctor
```

### 2. Connect your MCP client

Here are ready-to-use examples for common coding agents. Other MCP-compatible clients can point to the same local `agentune` command.

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add agentune --scope user -- agentune
```

#### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add agentune -- agentune
```

#### OpenCode

Add this to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "agentune": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["agentune"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start your coding session

Your MCP client launches `agentune` automatically. The dashboard is available at `http://localhost:3737` after the first connection.

Useful daemon commands:

```bash
agentune --help
agentune doctor
agentune start
agentune stop
```

Use `agentune doctor` to confirm Node.js, `mpv`, bundled `yt-dlp`, system `yt-dlp`, config paths, and daemon health before you start playback.

Use `agentune start` when you want the background daemon running before your agent connects, or when `autoStartDaemon` is disabled.

### 4. Send your first prompts

```text
play some musics. id like Vietnamese song only, V-Pop, Indie, RAP, Ballad.
```

Use that first prompt to define your taste/persona in plain language. The agent can save that preference and reuse it later.

After that, a simple prompt is enough:

```text
Play some musics
```

The agent should read your saved taste, recent listening history, top artists, and top keywords, then choose music that fits instead of starting from zero each time.

If you want to change taste later, just say it naturally. For example:

```text
play some musics. i want more chill Vietnamese indie and fewer rap tracks tonight.
```

The agent can update the saved taste text, then continue using the new preference on later picks.

> Tip: if your coding setup supports subagents, you can dedicate one subagent to keep the playlist going during the whole work session. In repos that use `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, you can also add a small instruction telling the agent to maintain playback, queue the next fitting track, and adapt when you describe a new taste.

## Main Capabilities

- Save a simple free-text music taste/persona across sessions
- Let the agent use saved taste, recent plays, top artists, and top keywords for future picks
- Play a song immediately or add it to the queue
- Pause, resume, skip, and adjust volume
- Check what is playing right now
- Review recent listening history
- Update the taste/persona text any time in plain language
- Run `agentune doctor` to inspect runtime dependencies and local daemon health

## Browser Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3737` to see:

- now-playing track and progress
- pause/resume and next controls
- volume slider
- live queue
- listening insights from local history
- taste editor
- cleanup actions and explicit daemon stop

## Runtime Notes

On first run, agentune creates `${AGENTUNE_DATA_DIR || ~/.agentune}/config.json`.

Most useful settings:

- `dashboardPort`: browser dashboard port, default `3737`
- `daemonPort`: local daemon port, default `3747`
- `defaultVolume`: initial playback volume
- `autoStartDaemon`: automatically start the daemon when your agent connects

If `autoStartDaemon` is `false`, start the daemon yourself before connecting:

```bash
agentune start
```

The daemon keeps playing in the background after the agent session closes. It stops only when you run `agentune stop` or click `Stop daemon` in the dashboard.

`agentune doctor` treats Node.js, runtime config, `mpv`, and the bundled `yt-dlp` binary as required checks. System `yt-dlp` and daemon stopped state are reported as advisory warnings instead of hard failures.
